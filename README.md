SBCC Computer Science Club
=========================== 

##What's up Hackers!

I'm now releasing the code for the CS Club Website. As you can tell, we're going for a single page design.
I've set it up in a simple and readable way so you guys can have an easier time editing it.
If you have any questions email me at  [alberto@albertovillalobos.me](mailto:alberto@albertovillalobos.me), 
anything other form of communication look for in [albertovillalobos.me](http://albertovillalobos.me) 



## Features
We have planned the following features for the website:

* Responsive
* Single Page
* Fullscreen video on splash
* API integration with Facebook for pictures, events, etc.
* Carrousel of pictures on "about us" section
* And more!

##Proposed ideas

If you guys get any feature ideas, feel free to add them! For example, one of you wants to have a form to insert tutorials. Add those here and make sure you take a crack at it, we'll merge the code together. Learn Git!


##Finally

Remember that this project is meant to be a learning experience for all, among other uses. So make sure to ask as many questions as you have, I'll be glad to help! Also, Google is your friend.
Happy hacking!
